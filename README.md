# PocketBase Implementation

PocketBase is a completely opensource, completely free, self-hosted Firebase and SupaBase alternative.  

This README contains instructions for getting PocketBase started as a service with a service account on Ubuntu with a Nginx reverse-proxy.  

You could choose not to expose PocketBase to the web at all and only access the API from the server itself.
